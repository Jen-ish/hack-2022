Idea Title:
Visual Assistance for the Visually Impaired

IDEA PITCH

Introduction to Problem:
-In this 21st century, a world of technologies, one problem that is yet to be solved are the challenges invited by visual impairness.
Even today there are nearly 285 million people in the world that are visually impaired. Although technology has grown leaps
and bounds, technological assistance for such differently abled people are still far and few between and the easy accessibility of
the world's features without assistance from others is a concept that is still quite foreign and far-fetched.
-Keeping the above factors in mind, we wanted to come up with a technological solution for assistance for the visually impaired.
The primary objective is to make their life easier by guiding them to the objects that they need using vibration and guiding them to avoid objects like
proximity sensors, among other things, when they're outdoors.

Our Approach for Solution:
For the first part of indoor guidance, the user of our system speaks into a microphone, the audio is then sent for voice recognition to decipher
their required object. We then pass it into an object detection algorithm to get the coordinates of the desired object and finally vibration
/text-to-speech to guide them to the object. The choice of using vibration motors is a deliberate one as blind people are known to have their
brain automatically rewired for increased sensitivity and effectiveness of their other senses.

Platform/Technology we will use:
-Raspberry Pi
-Objection Detection using openCV
-Voice Recognition
